 *  GOALS
 *  1. Send a prompt to get the user's name in the browser.
 *  2. Send a prompt to greet the user and ask how their day is.
 *  3. Get the sentiment score from the user's response.
 *  4. Using conditionals, find whether the user feels good or bad.
 *  5. Send a prompt with a logical response to get why the user feels good or bad.
 *  6. Use your own creativity to continue the conversation. Good luck and have fun!
 *
 *  HINT: Every time you want to get the sentiment score from a variable e.g. x, type var result = sentiment.predict(x)
