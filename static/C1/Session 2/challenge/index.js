 *
 *  GOALS
 *  1. Send a prompt asking for the mathematical expression as the variable, expression.
 *     Examples of valid, mathematical expressions are 1 + 2, 3 - 1, 6 * 5, 6 / 3, etc
 *  2. Send an alert with the expression and answer in the browser. e.g. 1 + 2 is equal to 3
 *
 *  HINT: Instead of using parseInt() in the first step, use eval() instead.
 *
 *
 *
 *  INSTRUCTIONS
 *  Step 1: Type a prompt function inside eval() on line 29 assigned to the variable, expression to complete the first step.
 *  Step 2: Type an alert function on line 30 with the variable, expression, inside it.
